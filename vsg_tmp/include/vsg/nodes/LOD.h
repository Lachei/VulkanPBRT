     *  Children should be ordered with the highest resolution Child first, thought to lowest resolution LOD child last.
     *  The Child struct stores the visibleHeightRatio and child that it's associated with.
     *  During culling tHe visibleHeightRatio is used as a ratio of screen height that Bound sphere occupies on screen needs to be at least in order for the associated child to be traversed.
     *  Once on child passes this test no more children are checked, so that no more than on child will ever being traversed in a record traversal.
     *  If no Child pass the visible height test then none of the LOD's children will be visible.
     *  During the record traversals the Bound sphere is also checked against the view frustum so that LOD's also enable view frustum culling for subgraphs so there is no need for a separate CullNode/CullGroup to decorate it. */
