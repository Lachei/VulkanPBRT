# VulkanSceneGraph Headers
For convenience the [include/vsg/all.h](all.h) header is provided that includes all headers for you.  While quick to add to your code it will likely slow compilation compared to explicitly including just the headers you need.

```C++
#include <vsg/all.h> // prefer convenience over compile speed
```

The headers that provide the library classes and definitions are organized in subdirectories with the *include/vsg/directory_name* based on the category of functionality the header provides.  All C++ classes and function definitions provided are enclosed in vsg namespace.  The vsg subdirectories/categories are:

## Lower level classes that provide basic glue of the scene graph
* [include/vsg/core](core/) - Base classes & memory management
* [include/vsg/maths](maths/) - GLSL style maths classes
* [include/vsg/io](io/) - File system, stream and native file format support
* [include/vsg/threading](threading/) - Threading class that build upon std::thread.
* [include/vsg/utils](utils/) - Utility classes/template functions

## Vulkan integration classes and associated scene graph nodes
* [include/vsg/vk](vk/) - Vulkan integration classes - application level rather than scene grah lelve
* [include/vsg/commands](commands/) - VkCmd related scene graph classes
* [include/vsg/state](state/) - VkDescritorSet/VkDescriptor state related scene graph classes

## Scene graphs nodes
* [include/vsg/nodes](nodes/) - Scene graph node classes
* [include/vsg/text](text/) - Scene graph node classes that provide high quality Text support
* [include/vsg/rtx](rtx/) - RTX Raytracing and mesh shader related scene graph classes

## Application level
* [include/vsg/traversals](traversals/) - Graph traversals
* [include/vsg/ui](ui/) - User Interface Event classes
* [include/vsg/platform](platform/) - Platform specific Windowing/support classes
* [include/vsg/viewer](viewer/) - Viewer/Windowing classes
